# SmallCalculator
A small calculator with the five simplest operations, written in Python in 100 lines or less!

(I wrote this when I was learning Python and I was throoghly amazed by how easy thig programming language is, so I decided to outdo all of my previous
attempts to write a calculator in Java, and it in less than 100 lines.)
